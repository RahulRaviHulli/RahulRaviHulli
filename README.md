I am an aspiring Cyber Security Analyst, who is currently pursuing a master's degree at Concordia University, Montreal. With a passion of mitigating cyber threats and driving digital forensic investigations, I strive to make a positive impact in cyber security. I have gained valuable experiences through virtual internships at ANZ in social engineering investigations and digital investigations through analyzing network packets, and at Telstra under log analysis, adding new rules to firewall and generating an incident postmortem report. I have also delivered valuable workshops on the topics of Endpoint Security and Cyber Forensics during my bachelors, which demonstrates my abilities of strong communication and healthy knowledge in both these fields. I am a quick and proactive learner who strives to gain more information and upskill on a regular basis. Additionally, I am also in pursuit to learn French, and have currently pursued the level A2 via the CEDA institute, Montreal.
